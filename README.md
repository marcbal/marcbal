### Hi, I'm Marc 👋

- 👨‍💼 I'm a DevOps engineer and I aim to improve developer's and system administrator's workflow.
- 👨‍🎓 I also have a PhD in computer science about [Virtual Reality interactions (fr)](https://theses.fr/2021LILUB024). You can find the related open source projects about [the selection technique](https://github.com/LokiResearch/RayCursor) and [the avatar facial expression control](https://github.com/LokiResearch/AvatarFacialExpressions) we made.
- ⛏️ I'm also the founder, developer and system administrator of a [Minecraft server](https://www.pandacube.fr/) since 2011. Part of its source code is available [on github](https://github.com/PandacubeFr) and [on a hosted repo](https://git.pandacube.fr/PandacubeFr).
- ⚙️ Finally, you can find some projects I made in [my repositories](https://github.com/marcbal?tab=repositories), from small games to code challenges.
